CS-330 Comp Graphic and Visualization 
•	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I would say new skill wise learning OpenGL has absolutely aided me in fine tuning my troubleshooting skills.  I had a lot of issues configuring Visual Studios each week until I ended up just moving the dependencies into the folder and working out of the same project folder each week.
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
Process wise I went about programming modularly. Each week I added new components to my project and ensured it ran both before and after the new additions.
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I will always program modularly to ensure that I have working software both before and after new implementation. 
•	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Strategies wise at times I tried working ahead after having a working 3D example. Though at times this didn’t always work to my benefit because I would get so involved in what I was working on would end up not meeting the assignment deadlines.
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration worked well with learning to develop for openGL, most of the primitives are developed through iterations of coordinates making up triangles. Repeating these and manipulating them to create different shapes.
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Through development, the only real change is my knowledge of how to code with openGL and what can and cannot be altered whole coding. While coding I continue to work slowly and modularly with small snippets of code at a time.
•	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
As I’m interested in a career in data science, Computational graphic will help to offer alternative ways to model data in a 3d environment. 
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Again this will help with modeling data in 3d and providing new ways to visualize data, it will also look great on a resume.
